# Stock-Predictor
This GitHub repository contains a stock price prediction model implemented in Python using a combination of Numpy, Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, and TSNE. 
The model predicts the stock price of Apple based on historical data of stock attributes from September 2013 to December 2022. 
The project also includes the optimization of time lag values and polynomial degrees for improved prediction accuracy. 
Additionally, it evaluates model performance, bias, and visualizes results using error analysis and 3D plots with TSNE, contributing to data-driven investment insights.
